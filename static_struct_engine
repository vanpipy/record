# TO BUILD STATIC BOX

Box, I define this like a box.
In daily work, static page develop cost lots of time,
only cause it's need a lot of repeat action, like paste, copy and so on.

This repeat action, the tech-back-end can fix it well.
Here, I use Nodejs to complete thie part.

But another question is coming.
How to rebuild web view page?
Just like the tag <link>, <script> and even the <html>, <body>, <div>,
all of the html tag.

Maybe the way start can be this.
First, A javascript manager, it is can does something as the local config.
Second, anonymous function manager which can manage golbal and local function to
avoid variable conflict.

# Here is the first part.

1.build javascript manager
--1.1 get local config.
--1.2 anonymous manager

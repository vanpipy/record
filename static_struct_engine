# TO BUILD STATIC BOX

Box, I define this like a box.
In daily work, static page develop cost lots of time,
only cause it's need a lot of repeat action, like paste, copy and so on.

This repeat action, the tech-back-end can fix it well.
Here, I use Nodejs to complete thie part.

But another question is coming.
How to rebuild web view page?
Just like the tag <link>, <script> and even the <html>, <body>, <div>,
all of the html tag.

Maybe the way start can be this.
First, A javascript manager, it is can does something as the local config.
Second, anonymous function manager which can manage golbal and local function to
avoid variable conflict.

# Here is the first part.

1.build javascript manager
--1.1 get local config.
--1.2 anonymous manager

Charpter 1
--1.1
  How to get local config?
  (function(){
    ...doSomething...
  }();
  In this code, it will run at now in javascript, so we take this.
  
  We need the absolute path of local config, so get all script node in document
  it's necessary. 
  At first, get all script node and filter node, get the name 'local' or
  other custom config base name.

  So this base model when the local.js running is that take a 
  functin (fn(){...})() in this code we get a absolute path of config file.

As we know, a web page consist of document object module, 
and the html tag like <html>, <body>, <div>, <h1>, <section>...
They are the great one in this world. But there is one problem for me,
How can we access to they when we face one computer as a develop?

Luckly some great people make very usefull application program interface,
like document API, getElementById, getElementsByTagName,
getElementsByClassName...

However, every time when we use this API, Em..yes, it does work, but, 
it's really kill my time. Great ones make a lot of  web brower, ok, 
lots of brower have their own API. More important! THE API IS DIFFERENT!

OK, now I just want to make a simply selector, only can distinguish the string
input and output DOM element.

I make a important decision to name this new born selector.
simple type selector for css in web brower, yes it is a tool made by javascript.
Name is for simply pick document element like bot arm -- barm.

# The history of HTML

## What is the HTML?
The HTML was considered a [SGML](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language) application by Berners-Lee who draft it and it's a markup language at same time.

## The purpose of HTML
> The html is markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual and audible web pages.

Dose that means the html borns for displaying something in web browsers? Maybe. The fact i can ensure is that HTML as markup language used to write and share documents,\
and the web browsers become a rich soil which HTML hide in and waiting flowers bloom. So the HTML's purpose is for transporting and displaying content, i guess.

## The meaning of HTML
TODO.

## When HTML borns, what happened at the same time?
First, timeline about HTML:

* 1991.10 HTML Tags, an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.
* 1992.6 First draft of the HTML DTD.
* 1992.11 HTML DTD 1.1
* 1993.6 Hypertext Markup Language was published by the IETF IIIR Working Group as an Internet Draft (a rough proposal for a standard). It was replaced by a second version one month later, followed by six further drafts published by IETF itself that finally led to HTML 2.0 in RFC 1866.
* 1993.11 HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet Draft and was a competing proposal to the Hypertext Markup Language draft. It expired in May 1994.
* 1995.4 HTML 3.0 was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later (28 September 1995) without further action.
* 1997.1 HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.
* 1997.12 HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
* 1998.4 HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
* 1999.12 HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.
* 2000.5 ISO/IEC 15445:2000("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.
* 2008.1 HTML5 was published as a Working Draft by the W3C.
* 2011.2 the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification.
* 2012.7 In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG.
* 2014.9 In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.
* 2016.11 HTML 5.1 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
* 2017.12 HTML 5.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation.

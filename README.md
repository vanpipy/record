# Remember
The purpose of learning a programming language is to become a better programmer; that is, to to become more effective at designing and implementing new systems and at maintaining old ones.

# The difference between ECMAScript prototype and OOP.
In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behaviour.
In ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, and structure, behaviour, and state are all inherited.

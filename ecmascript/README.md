# The difference between ECMAScript prototype and OOP.
In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behaviour.
In ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, and structure, behaviour, and state are all inherited.

# Java learning
it from the java tutorials for JDK 8.

# Language basics
* Variables
    + Instance Variables(Non-Static Fields)
    + Class Variables(Static Fields) `final static int numGears = 6;`
    + Local Variables `init count = 0;`
    + Parameters `public static void main(String[] args)`
    + Naming - it's no different to other code language.
* Operators
* Expressions, Statements, and Blocks
* Control Flow Statements

# Classes and Objects
* Classes
* Objects
* Nested Classes
* Enum Types

# Annotations
Annotations, a form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. Annotations hav no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate.

Annotations have a number of uses, among them:

* Infomation for the compiler - Annotations can be used by the compiler to detect errors or suppress warnings.
* Compiler-time and deployment-time processing - Software tools can process annotation infomation to generate code, XML files, and so forth.
* Runtime processing - Some annotations are availdable to be examined at runtime.

# Interfaces and Inheritance
* Interfaces
* Inheritance

# Numbers and Strings
* Numbers
* Strings

# Generics
The compiler-time bugs can be detected easier than others, so the Generics add stability to your code by making more of your bugs detectable at compiler time.

# Packages
Packages are a feature of the Java programing language that help you to organize and structure your classes and their relationships to one another.

# Object-Oriented Programing Concepts
It's some good questions for the concepts about OOP.

* What is an Object?
    + Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology cause the examples exist everywhere, your dog, your bicycle, your television set.
    + Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. Dogs have state(name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior(barking, fetching, wagging tail). Bicycle also have state(current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and behavior(changing gear, changing pedal cadence,applying brakes). Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programing.
